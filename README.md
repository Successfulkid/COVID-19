           <h3><span class="dorian">About Coronavirus</span></h3>
    <p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
    <h3 id="before-a-hurricane"><span class="dorian">How it spreads</span></h3>
   <P>Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.</>
      <h3 id="during-a-hurricane"><span class="dorian">How to protect yourself</span></h3>

        <li>Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell</li>
